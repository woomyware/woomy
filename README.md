## A feature-rich and configurable Discord bot for music, moderation, currency and more!

**Links**
* [Official bot invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=435961704145485835&permissions=2134240503&scope=bot)
* [For updates and support join my Discord server!](https://discord.gg/HCF8mdv)

## Using Woomy

The easiest and recommended way to use Woomy is to invite the official version to your server, which is hosted 24/7 and gets the newest updates as soon as they come out. The invite can be found above, under links. You can also self-host, but no support will be provided to you if you decide to do this.
